# About me

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://engineering.ucsc.edu/departments/statistics/) at [the University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu), advised by Prof. [Zehang Richard Li](https://zehangli.com/index.html).
I am interested in Bayesian statistics and its application to sociology, economics, and public health.
Currently, I am working on a verbal autopsy dataset and developing statistical tools for a dynamic survey design.
